This is a little Nautilus extension I wrote in python to extract a DMG to the current directory. Nothing fancy, it may not even work for you. This is really just for me.

===Depends===

This isn't all-inclusive, but: pygtk, python (a stock install should be fine), nautilus, etc.

===Installing===

One line: sudo make install-new

If you're on Debian Lenny or older, it's (as root): make install-old
